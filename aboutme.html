            <p class = "about-me-paragraph">
                Hello, I am Jax Yoon, I am of Korean ethnicity, but I am Canadian. I loved coding from an early age, ever since I was introduced to it. However, despite my passion for coding, I want to become a doctor. I'm also a penguin-lover, and I love reading books. I'm 14, and I live in Port Moody, BC, Canada. My favourite TV show  is House, MD. I also love video games, mostly metroidvania or sandbox/PvP based.
