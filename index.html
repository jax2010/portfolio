                Hello, I am Jax Yoon, and I am from BC, Canada. This website is designed to showcase the projects and progress that I have made over the years. I have coded for a long time, mostly to see how I could make my own video games. My passion has extended to beyond just games, and I am creating projects such as this website. My main coding languages are Python, Java, and Html

            <p class = "projects-paragraph">
                Most of my projects are done through Python, Java, or Unity. I loved creating games since I was little, it gave me a sense of wonder that I could make creations that I loved so often. I mostly used Pixelpad for my python development, it was more or less a stepping stone for me. It was the easiest platform to use, and I had a lot of in-depth guides. I used Replit for Java, and it brought me into the world of intermediate coding. The Java projects I learned at Replit were very different from those I made at pixelpad. It was not so much a game, and more different types of functions. However, this was still fun, and lead me into the world of less beginner-oriented coding. Unity was the perfect balance between intermediate projects and beginner games. It was still very hard to use, and learn, but it helped me create projects that were beyond the scope of my abilities with pixelpad. There, I learned multiple different things such as layouts, design, and C# (which I do not fully understand).
